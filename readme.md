## Introduction

This tutorial aims to guide you through the process of building a PC, from selecting components to the final assembly. We will cover the following:

1. Motherboard (MB)
2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
3. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
4. Random Access Memory (RAM)
5. Power Supply Unit (PSU)
6. Solid State Drive (SSD)
7. Case

If you want to use the specific components that I used for this tutorial, feel free to do so. Otherwise, you will need the following:

- **Motherboard:** The skeleton of your PC.
- **CPU:** The brain of your PC.
- **GPU:** The muscle of your PC.
- **RAM:** Fast storage memory to help your CPU think faster.
- **PSU:** Generates power for your PC.
- **Storage Unit (SSD):** Faster than a typical hard drive.
- **Case:** The protective skin for your PC.
- **Cooling Unit:** Various options are available for cooling.

### Components Used

- **Case:** NZXT H6 Flow
- **Motherboard:** B650 GAMING X AX from GIGABYTE
- **RAM:** Four 5600MHz 16GB sticks
- **GPU:** RTX 4070 Super from MSI
- **SSD:** SAMSUNG 990 Pro 2TB
- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 7800 X3D
- **PSU:** RM750 from Corsair

## Let's Begin

### Step 1: Install the CPU

The first step is to take your motherboard out of the box. It's better to add as many components to the motherboard before installing it into the case. The first component to install is the CPU. The CPU socket is located in the middle of the motherboard.

### Step 2: Install the RAM

Next, install your RAM sticks. Insert them firmly into the RAM slots located to the right of the CPU socket.

### Step 3: Install the SSD

The SSD is very easy to install. Unscrew the SSD cover located under the CPU socket, insert the SSD, press it lightly, and screw it in. Replace the cover and screw it in.

### Step 4: Install the Motherboard

Once the CPU, SSD, and RAM are installed on the motherboard, screw the motherboard into the case.

### Step 5: Install the PSU

Take your PSU out of the box and find the PSU mount, located either at the bottom of the case or directly behind the motherboard. Place the PSU into the mount with the fan facing outwards. Insert the cables into the appropriate sockets on the PSU.

### Step 6: Install the GPU

Insert the GPU into the PCI-E slot on the motherboard, located under the SSD.

### Step 7: Install the Cooling System

For this build, I used a water pump for maximum cooling capability. Install the radiator on the top mount of the case, ensuring the fans are screwed in beforehand. Then, install the water pump head.

### Step 8: Connect the Front Panel Headers

Plug in your front panel headers according to the image below.

### Step 9: Install Power Cables

Plug in all the power connectors. Start with the CPU power connector, located in the top left corner of the motherboard. Next, plug in the PCI-E connector for the GPU. Finally, plug in the 24-pin power connector for the motherboard.

## Finishing Up

Once everything is installed, plug your PC into an outlet. If everything was done correctly, it should start without any issues. The last step is to install your operating system.
